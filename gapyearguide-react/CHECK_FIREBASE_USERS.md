# Check Firebase Users

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/gapyearguide-aaf58/authentication/users

2. This will show you all registered users in Firebase

3. If the list is empty, you need to create a new account via the signup page

4. If you see users, make sure you're using the exact email that's listed there

---

## Quick Fix:

Just create a new account at: http://localhost:5173/signup

Use any email/password you want - it will be saved to Firebase and work properly.
